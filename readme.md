# doc

## virtual doc

you can have a doc that does not physically exist but is generated every time the url is called. Let take an example of invoice

`http://localhost:3002/api/docs/id-cards/234.pdf`

It kind of takes data from the data source configured in the engine and uses a pre-configured template - renders it as pdf


if a file is virtual - it means that there would not be any associated store with it.
